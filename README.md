Isolation Forest is an anomaly detection algorithm that identifies outliers by isolating data points in a dataset. For credit card fraud detection, the algorithm creates a series of decision trees to partition the data. Points that require fewer splits to isolate are considered anomalies, potentially indicating fraudulent transactions. Python's `scikit-learn` library provides an implementation of Isolation Forest, making it straightforward to apply this method to credit card transaction data for identifying suspicious activity.
